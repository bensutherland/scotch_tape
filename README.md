# Double-cask Scotch-Tape

## A Poem for the Weekend

It's late Friday  
My brain flew away  
Someone mentionned scotch  
I think it's a must  

Come with me friend  
The rules we will bend  
I'll get two glasses  
We'll sit on our'asses  

Drinking the elixir  
We will time away  
As we sink into decay  
To wake up on Monday  

Drinking the elixir  
An impromptu mixer  
As we sink into the fumes  
The beast of Monday looms
