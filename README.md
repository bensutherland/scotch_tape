# Double-Cask Scotch-Tape

## A Poem for the Weekend

It's late Friday  
My brain flew away  
Someone mentioned Scotch  
That's something I've got

Come with me friend  
Two braincases to mend    
I'll get two glasses  
We'll sit on our asses  

Drinking the elixir  
An impromptu mixer  
Yet, as we sink in the fumes  
The beast of Monday looms
